## Project Description
This project is a simple recipe website built using the HTML skills I've recently learned on The Odin Project. The purpose of this project is to practice creating a website with basic HTML elements, such as headings, paragraphs, ordered and unordered lists, and more.

By the end of this project, I hope to have a better understanding of how to structure a website using HTML, as well as how to create well-formatted content that is easy to read and follow. I also hope to have a collection of delicious recipes that I can refer back to whenever I'm in need of culinary inspiration.

## Project Goals
1. Create a simple recipe website using HTML
2. Practice using HTML elements such as headings, paragraphs, and lists
3. Develop skills in structuring and formatting web content
4. Compile a collection of easy-to-follow recipes for personal reference
